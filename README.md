### How to install

Instructions will differ for every platform, but I can tell you how to install it on Arch Linux:

1. Install and enable `lightdm` and `lightdm-webkit-greeter`
2. In the terminal, `cd` to `/usr/share/lightdm-webkit/themes/`
3. Clone this repository here, it should create a folder called `lightdm-webkit-slac`
4. Enable the theme in your `/etc/lightdm/lightdm-webkit-greeter.conf`
